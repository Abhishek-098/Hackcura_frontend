Our security model not only consists of all conventional approaches but also enriched with modern methodologies that suits best for such big organizations like EaseMyTrip.

"The strength of the chain is decided by its weakest link" so as EasyMyTrip is having 150+ subdomains (where 88 subdomains are live), if any single subdomain is not secure, it can harm the whole company. So our approach is to find all the assets, prioritize them based on how famous or important the asset is, secure this asset and later move on to the less famous subdomains and asset while following the iterative model for the main assets.
